# VLSI Design Automation Algorithms
In this project, Lee's and Hadlock's maze routing algorithms are implemented. These algorithms are usually used in the routing phase of VLSI physical design. 

## Workflow
1. auto.cpp module randomly generates a maze with easily adjustable size and obstacle ratio
2. the algorithms are called to process the generated maze
3. results are visualized

## Visualized Results
**.** -> unvisited available vertices; **+** -> vertices on the shortest path; 

**o** -> vertices which are visited but not part of the path; **B** -> vertices blocked by obstacle; 

**S** -> source vertex; **T** -> target vertex.
